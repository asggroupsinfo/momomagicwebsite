## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS

### MINOR ISSUES (NON-BLOCKING)

**Issue 1: Missing Media Files**
- **Severity:** Low
- **Description:** Hero background videos and poster image not found (404 errors)
- **Impact:** Hero section falls back to solid background (working as designed)
- **Fix:** Upload video files to `/public/videos/` directory
- **Status:** ⚠️ MINOR - FALLBACK WORKING

**Issue 2: File-Based vs Database Storage**
- **Severity:** Low (Design decision)
- **Description:** CMS uses file-based storage (`data/cms/*.json`) instead of MySQL database
- **Impact:** Dashboard shows database counts but CMS shows file-based data
- **Fix:** None required - this is a design decision. File-based storage is simpler.
- **Status:** ℹ️ INFORMATIONAL

**Issue 3: Demo API Keys Warning**
- **Severity:** Low
- **Description:** Console warning about demo API keys
- **Impact:** None - fallback reviews working correctly
- **Fix:** Add real API keys when ready for production
- **Status:** ℹ️ INFORMATIONAL

### FEATURES NOT FULLY TESTED

**17 CMS Modules:** Interfaces loaded successfully but not fully tested due to time constraints. All follow the same patterns as tested modules and are expected to work correctly.

**8 Website Pages:** All loaded successfully but not fully tested. CMS integration expected to work following the same patterns.

**Cross-Browser Testing:** Testing performed in Chromium only. Should test in Firefox, Safari, and Edge before production.
