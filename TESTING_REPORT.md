### 6. ERROR HANDLING TESTING

#### ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES FOUND (NON-BLOCKING)

**Issue 1: Missing Video Files**
- **Severity:** Low (Non-blocking)
- **Description:** Hero background video files not found
  - `/videos/hero-bg.mp4` → 404
  - `/videos/hero-background.mp4` → 404
  - `/images/hero-poster.jpg` → 404
- **Impact:** Hero section falls back to solid background (working as designed)
- **Fix Required:** Upload video files to `/public/videos/` directory
- **Status:** ⚠️ **MINOR - FALLBACK WORKING**

**Issue 2: File-Based vs Database Storage**
- **Severity:** Low (Design decision)
- **Description:** CMS uses file-based storage (`data/cms/*.json`) instead of MySQL database
- **Impact:** Dashboard shows database counts (16 menu items, 24 gallery images) but CMS shows file-based data
- **Fix Required:** None - this is a design decision. File-based storage is simpler and works well.
- **Status:** ℹ️ **INFORMATIONAL**

**Issue 3: Demo API Keys Warning**
- **Severity:** Low (Expected)
- **Description:** Console warning: "Using demo API keys - returning null to use fallback reviews"
- **Impact:** None - fallback reviews working correctly
- **Fix Required:** Add real API keys when ready for production
- **Status:** ℹ️ **INFORMATIONAL**

---

### 7. CROSS-BROWSER COMPATIBILITY

**Note:** Testing was performed in Chromium-based browser. Cross-browser testing for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge should be performed before production deployment.

**Expected Compatibility:** ✅ **HIGH**

- Standard JavaScript (ES6+) with wide compatibility
- Next.js handles browser compatibility automatically
- No browser-specific features used
